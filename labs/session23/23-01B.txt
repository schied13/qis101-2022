After 10,000 shots there is a 100% chance of measuring only a value of 0 for the classical bit
because state vector 4's amplitudes are non-zero for states 1 and 4. These states have binary
representation 001 and 100 or ket representation |001> and |100>. These states both contain qubit 1
(q1) with a logical 0. Therfore, since there is no probability that any state with q1 being a logical 1
the measured value will always collapse to 0 when measured.
