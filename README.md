# 2022 Brookhaven National Laboratory Co-Design Center for Quantum Advantage(C2QA) Quantum Computing Summer School

This repository is a culmination of the different programming and non-programming tasks that were completed
for the 2022 C2QA Quantum Computing Summer School

## Description

The summer school is a paid six-week program where I attended daily lectures. The program is meant to give students an overview 
of areas of applied quantum physics in an effort to educate the future workforce about the possible benefits of using quantum information science(QIS)
or expose the students to a career in QIS. The effort is organized under the Co-Design Center for Quantum Advantage(C2QA) a research center led
by Brookhaven National Laboratory. C2QA is one of five Department of Energy QIS research centers. This experience was completed during the summer after my Freshman
Year of undergraduate studies. 

## Overview of Topics Covered

- Introduction to Scientific Computing
- Quantum Circuits
- Monte Carlo Methods
- Python(numpy & matplotlib)
- Information Theory
- Probability and Statistics
- Introductory Quantum Mechanics
- Fourier Analysis
- Linear Algebra
